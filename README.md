# Phonemon-DB: Phonemon Monster Database E-R Analysis & SQL Implementation


## Overview

The **Phonemon Monster Database** project involves using a database to store information about the Phonemon Monsters. The project aims to analyze this data with the help of **Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagrams** and SQL implementations. The relationships between various entities are explored and represented in the database, enabling effective analysis of the data.

## Files in the Repository

- **Phonemon_2021.sql**: SQL file containing the database schema and initial data for the Phonemon Monsters.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project and explains the repository’s contents.
- **exp1-report-201850076.pdf**: A report detailing the findings and methodology of the first experiment, including database design and queries.
- **exp1-solution-template.sql**: A template SQL file for solving the first experiment’s problems with provided solutions.

## Project Description

This project utilizes **relational databases** to store information regarding the Phonemon Monsters. The database is built based on **E-R diagrams** that model the different entities involved, such as monsters, trainers, and battles. Understanding these relationships and translating them into **SQL queries** is key to managing and analyzing the data effectively.

## Key Concepts

- **Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagrams**: These diagrams represent the relationships between different entities in the system, such as **Phonemons**, **Trainers**, and **Battles**.
- **SQL Queries**: Structured queries are used to manipulate and retrieve data from the database, ensuring accurate insights and analysis.
- **Relational Database Design**: Involves structuring the data tables to maintain consistency, integrity, and the relationships between entities.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Database Design**: Learn how to design a relational database from real-world entities using E-R diagrams.
2. **SQL Implementation**: Gain hands-on experience in writing SQL queries for data manipulation, retrieval, and analysis.
3. **Data Relationships**: Understand how to define and enforce relationships between entities in a database.

## MIT Student's Perspective

As a student at MIT, this project demonstrates the core principles of **database design** and **SQL programming**. The ability to represent real-world systems through E-R diagrams and translate them into effective SQL queries is crucial for anyone looking to work in the field of **data management** and **software engineering**. This project teaches the practical use of relational databases for storing complex data and ensuring that it can be efficiently analyzed and manipulated.
